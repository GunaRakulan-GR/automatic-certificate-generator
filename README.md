# Automatic Certificate Generator

## Introduction

In life, automating the boring stuff is the main key to be a productive person. This simple python prototype generates certificates based on the given name list automatically.

The problem that, this simple python script tries to solve is re-entering the name of the certificate holder.

This script uses Python & OpenCV as its main component to sort out the problem. The logic is pretty simple to understand, It takes a template of a certificate and generates more certificates based on the given name list.


## Usage

- Step 1: Enter the list of certificate holder names to the name-data.txt
- Step 2: Run the script

## Run

```
python run.py

```
